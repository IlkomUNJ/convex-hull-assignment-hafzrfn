I started by reading about convex hulls from the book deberg2008 and watched some youtube videos on the topic of convex hulls. I then proceeded to use gemini for assistance in navigating through the UI of Qt since I was still unfamiliar and then asking about the task at hand. The query I used specifically consists of:

- Guide me through the Qt UI to create and implement slow convex hull and convex hull, explaining to me these terms in the process
- Guide me through how to implement these codes inside Qt itself, as the program needs a canvas, a run and clear drawing button
- Guide me step by step how to make it so that it keep tracks of the iteration, outputting the final iteration number on canvas
